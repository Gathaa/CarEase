Welcome To Our Repository, 
This Is Was For a small project about building a mobile application ,nowadays most of the car owners get confused with the dates related to their car suck as maintainance check date , oil change date , etc .. .CarEase is the solution here CarEase is a mobile software application that reminds the user of a specific date check for their car also allowing them to search for the closest mechanical shop and he will access to the store ratings categories and even its location.Also , there is a part for the mechanical when we can insert a specific shop by simply adding its name , categories and its location . At the end we wanna make sure that there is direct communication between the carowner and the mechanical and we provide the car owner with notification system in order to keep reminding him about his next check date . 
This Mobile App was designed with 
+(React Native (There is a one Typescript File )) for the Frontend
+Node.js And Expresss For the Backend
+MySql For The Database

Ps : This Application Was Built By {
    -Aimen Guedhami

If You wanna run the application on your Mobile Please read this Reminder
Quick Reminder : 
    in order to run the server with nodemon {all you have to is type "npm run dev"};
    this will make it easier for you , instead of relaunching the server everytime !
    BTW make sure to create a file .env in your backend folder , just for security !!!
    no need to add it in the frontend folder it may cause some problems just type the IP address and the server port manually !!
    The content of .env should be as followed :

    {
        serverport = 'your port',
        user='your db user',
        host='your host',
        password='your db password ',
        database='the name of your schema',
        port='your db port',

    }
